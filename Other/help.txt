Here is a collection of other code files I used at some point that may be helpful.

---- VibeImageProcessing.py ---- 
Playing around with turning vibration data into graphs.

---- Accelo.html ------ 
Quick web thing made to test if your computer has an accelerometer. May not work.

---- RecordVibe ---- 
Quickly test rercording data from the Arduino.
Can be modified to do all the signal processing instead of dealing with the cloud and web page for easier development.
