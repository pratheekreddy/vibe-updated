### Starting the Web server ###

Refer to this documentation to setup for your OS: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/

We used Windows so to start the server we opened up CMD and navigated to the 'flask-intro' folder and ran this command:

'flask run --host=0.0.0.0 -p 80'

This allows any ip address to connect using port 80, because we use HTTP requests.
Originally we hosted this on an AWS EC2 Instance and allowed access through port 80.

The web server is now running. 

//pratheek:
this code only works for flask version 2.0.1
