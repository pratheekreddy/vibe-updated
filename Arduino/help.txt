You should install the Arduino IDE app on your computer.
This app lets you upload your code to the arduino and test that it is running properly.

Use the included book for help understanding how to use the Arduino.
page 41 gives good info about the resistors.
page 125 gives a useful demo.

The vibration sensor seems to work best when it is flat on the surface, so I usually add a little tape.

I don't remember exactly what code I have pushed to the Arduino, but the other file in this folder is my best guess at what it is.
You can't see the code that is currently running on the Arduino, so make sure to save the code somewhere if you push something else.
