Here are a collection of notes that hopefully help with the mobile app portion of the project.
This entire directory should be the root folder in Android Studio. There are important files that will handle 
dependencies and properties that make it necessary to not just grab the 'MainActivity.java' file on its own.

The app was taken from something that already exists and modified to work for the porject, so there may be
some unnecessary things in the code.

---- Setup ----
You will need Android Studio for your computer.
Good to have introductory knowledge of Java.
It will be good to create a virtuial device matching your phone's spec in the AVD Manager 


---- Useful Files ----
1. MainActivity.java
	Path: src/main/java/com/example/vibrationauthentication/MainActivity.java
	Description: Where the main code is written

2. build.gradle
	Description: Here ou can set the version number of your app

3. content_main.xml
	Path: src/main/res/layout/content_main.xml
	Description: Here is where you can create the app UI

4. activity_main.xml
	Path: src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
	Description: Another file for UI design


---- Building and testing ----
The app can be tested by setting up a virtual device in the AVD manager and pressing the green play button.
This will launch a virtual phone with the app on it. 
When running, the will be a tab in the bottom of Android Studio called "Run". Here you can see console outputs and errors.

When ready to deploy to the phone, go to "Build" -> "Build Bundles / APKs" -> "Build APKs".
Plug in phone to computer, locate the APK that is generated, and move it to the phone's folder titled "Research".
On the phone, go to the app called "Files", click on "Apps", click "App installed files" tab, and find your APK.

Note: If you want to have multiple versions of the app on the phone, you will have to change the app's version number.
